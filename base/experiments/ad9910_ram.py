class RAMProfile:
    """A RAM profile of a DDS channel.

    RAM profile is an operation mode that feeds RAM data into the DDS as DDS
    parameter(s) (frequency/phase/amplitude). At an user-defined time interval,
    the DDS fetches a new RAM data and updates the selected parameter. See the
    arguments of the constructor (__init__(..)) to tune the interval, DDS
    parameter and data selection of the RAM playback.

    All RAM profiles in the same AD9910 has access to the same 1024 x 32-bits
    RAM. There are 1024 entries, each entry occupies 32-bits.

    Unlike single-tone profiles, RAM profiles only specifies a subset of
    parameters. The remaining parameters are specified through the FTW/POW/ASF
    registers instead (See AD9910Map class).

    For example, a frequency RAM profile feeds RAM as frequencies. Phase and
    amplitude are specified through POW and ASF registers respectively. These
    registers are controlled by the AD9910Map class.

    Reference: AD9910 datasheet (Rev. E), Theory of Operation, Mode Priority,
    Table 5: Data Source Priority

    Note: There are different data latencies between different RAM types.
    Amplitude takes 36 fewer sysclk cycles to reach the DDS output. Refer to
    AD9910 datasheet (Rev. E) p.6, Data Latency.

    Attributes:
        dest: int, the RAM data destination.
        start_addr: int, the starting RAM address of the RAM profile.
        end_addr: int, the ending (last) RAM address of the RAM profile.
        ram: list of int, encoded data for the RAM.
        step: int, the number of sysclk cycles per RAM step.
        ram_mode: int, the playback mode of the RAM.
        ram_type: RAMType, the type of RAM.
        nodwell_high: No-dwell high bit (default: 0, see AD9910 documentation).
        Ignored except for in RAM Ramp-Up Mode.

    Args:
        dds: AD9910, the DDS that will playback the RAM profile.
        data: list of float/2-tuples (elaborated below), the data (amplitude,
            phase, frequencies) to be put into the RAM.
            The type should be "list of float" for frequency/phase/amplitude
            RAM; and list of 2-tuples for polar RAM. The tuple consists of 2
            floats. The first represents phase, and the second represents
            amplitude.
        ramp_interval: float, the time interval between each step of the RAM
            mode playback. Keep the interval at a multiple of 4*T_sysclk
            (4*1 ns).
        ram_type: RAMType, see the RAMType enum.
        ram_mode: int, the playback mode of the RAM. AD9910 allows the
            following RAM playback modes.

            - RAM_MODE_DIRECTSWITCH:
                Only the first data in the RAM profile is fed to the DDS

            The other modes can fetch new RAM data to the DDS. The main
            difference is the behavior once the last data is fetched.

            - RAM_MODE_RAMPUP:
                DDS will not fetch anything after getting the last data.
            - RAM_MODE_BIDIR_RAMP:
                Same as RAM_MODE_RAMPUP. However, an additional ramp down mode
                is supported by setting profile=1.
            - RAM_MODE_CONT_BIDIR_RAMP:
                The RAM profile will ramp down after getting the last data.
                Then ramp up after getting the first data, and so on.
            - RAM_MODE_CONT_RAMPUP:
                The RAM profile will repeat itself after getting the last data
                from the RAM.

            See the following sections on the datasheet regarding the exact
            behavior of these 5 modes.
            - RAM Direct Switch Mode (p.33)
            - RAM Ramp-Up Mode (p.34, Figure 43)
            - RAM Bidirectional Ramp Mode (p.38, Figure 46)
            - RAM Continuous Bidirectional Ramp Mode (p.39, Figure 47)
            - RAM Continuous Recirculate Mode (p.40, Figure 48)
        dwell_end: negated no-dwell high bit (default: 1). Ignored except for in
        RAM Ramp-Up Mode.

            The entire load_ram() call is measured to have taken ~620 us
            (omitting the wasted cycles due to the RTIO FIFO being filled up).
            The difference between the RTIO timestamp cursor and the RTIO
            counter (slack) reduced by ~50 us (with the same omission).

            The omission was applied since providing excessive slack will only
            result in wasted clock cycles. load_ram() will hang and waste
            clock cycles if the RTIO FIFO is saturated. No more RTIO events
            could be submitted until some of these events are executed, which
            frees up the FIFO.

            Each RAM entry contributes to the slack loss. From experimentation
            and generalization, the first 127 RAM entries each contributes
            approximately ~60 ns of slack loss on average. The rest of the RAM
            entries each contributes to ~40 ns of slack loss on average.
